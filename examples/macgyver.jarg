-- Think like MacGyver and come up with at least three very creative plans to achieve the $goal using the list of $resources that we have.
* The less resources we have to use to achieve the goal, the better. The less time it would take to execute the plans, the better.
* For each plan, give it a score between 0% and 100% reflecting its efficacy in solving the problem.
-- Take the highest scored plan and the lowest scored plan and explain the difference in their scores.
