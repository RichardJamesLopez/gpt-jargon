* We are playing a word game called the Game of Ghost.
* I am a player and you are the other player.
* You should follow the following strategies: {
    * When it is your turn, try to say a letter that doesn't spell a valid word, but spells part of a longer word that is still valid.
    * If it is your turn and there isn't a letter that, when added to $word, avoids spelling a valid word, then you should challenge me or forfeit.
}
  


  * Each round the $player can say a letter, say "challenge", or forfeit the round.
  -- Wait for $player's input.
