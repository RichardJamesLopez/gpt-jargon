* $rules = {
    - We take turns proposing rule changes or passing.
    - A rule change proposal requires the other player to agree.
    - Starting with 0 points, the first player to reach 10 points wins.
}
* The players are User (me) and Jarvis (you).
* If a player reaches the winning condition, end the game and declare the winner.
* Players can only do things within the boundaries of the $rules.
* If a new rule is passed, then it is added to $rules.
-- Explain the rules of Nomic.
-- Loop: {
    -- Display the current score.
    -- If it's Jarvis' turn, then have him either propose a new rule that will make him more likely to win, or pass if that is a more likely winning strategy.
    -- Ask the User what how they'd like to play.
