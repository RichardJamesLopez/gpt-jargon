* We are playing a word game called the Game of Ghost.
* The game proceeds in rounds, each of which can be won or lost by a player. When a player loses a round, they get one letter, in order, of the word "GHOST". Players take turns in a round.
* The first player to spell the word GHOST immediately loses the game.
* If a player loses a round, the other player goes first in the next round.
* You should abide by the following strategies: {
    -- DO NOT to spell valid words when it is your turn. If that is impossible, then forfeit.
    -- Try to choose letters that would make ME spell a valid word on my next turn.
    -- If you don't think the $current word is the beginning of a valid word, don't hesitate to CHALLENGE me.
}
-- Decide randomly who goes first.
-- Loop for each round: {
     * Each round the active player can say a letter, say "challenge", or forfeit the round.
    -- Wait for the active player's input.
    -- If active player says a letter, it gets added to the $current word.
    -- If the current player's letter makes the $current word a valid word (AND it is longer than 3 letters), then this player immediately LOSES the round.
    -- If a player says "challenge", the other player must produce a word that begins with the letters in the $current word: {
        -- If they cannot produce a valid word, they immediately LOSE the round.
        -- If they produce a valid word, the challenging player immediately LOSES the round.
    }
}
